Goal: run your first `actionbook browser` workflow with a working local setup in under 2 minutes.

## Quick Setup (CLI)

1. Install the CLI:

```bash
npm install -g @actionbookdev/cli
```

2. Run the setup wizard (recommended):

```bash
actionbook setup
```

`setup` configures API key, browser mode, health checks, and optional agent skill installation in one flow.

3. Run your first browser commands:

```bash
actionbook browser open "https://example.com"
actionbook browser snapshot
actionbook browser close
```

If `snapshot` returns the page structure, your local setup is ready.

## What You Have

- Actionbook CLI installed
- Local config written to `~/.actionbook/config.toml`
- Browser automation verified with `actionbook browser ...`
