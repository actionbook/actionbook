# CLI Reference

The Actionbook CLI (`actionbook`) is the primary interface for interacting with Actionbook.

## `actionbook search`

Search for available action manuals.

**Usage:**

```bash
actionbook search [query]
```

**Arguments:**

- `query`: The search keyword (e.g., "airbnb", "google login").

**Example:**

```bash
actionbook search "airbnb search"
```

## `actionbook get`

Retrieve a specific action manual by its ID.

**Usage:**

```bash
actionbook get [actionId]
```

**Arguments:**

- `actionId`: The unique identifier of the action.

**Example:**

```bash
actionbook get "site/airbnb.com/page/home/element/search-button"
```

## `actionbook extension`

Browser extension bridge management commands.

### `actionbook extension install`

Download and install the Chrome extension from GitHub Releases to `~/.actionbook/extension/`.

- `--force` — Reinstall even if already installed at the same or newer version

### `actionbook extension status`

Check if the bridge server is running.

- `--port PORT` — Bridge server port to check (default: `19222`)

### `actionbook extension ping`

Send a heartbeat to the bridge server and measure round-trip latency.

- `--port PORT` — Bridge server port (default: `19222`)

### `actionbook extension stop`

Stop the running bridge server.

- `--port PORT` — Bridge server port (default: `19222`)

### `actionbook extension path`

Print the extension installation directory.

### `actionbook extension uninstall`

Remove installed extension files.

<Note>
  The bridge server auto-starts when you run any browser command with `--browser-mode=extension`. Manual management with `serve`/`stop` is rarely needed.

## `actionbook browser`

Browser automation commands.

### `actionbook browser open`

Open a URL in the browser.

**Usage:**

```bash
actionbook browser open [url]

### `actionbook browser click`

Click an element on the current page.

**Usage:**

```bash
actionbook browser click [selector]
```

**Arguments:**

- `selector`: The CSS selector, XPath, or other supported selector string.

### `actionbook browser fill`

Fill an input field with text.

**Usage:**

```bash
actionbook browser fill [selector] [value]
```

**Arguments:**

- `selector`: The target input element selector.
- `value`: The text value to input.

### Global Flags

These flags apply to all `actionbook browser` subcommands:

- `--browser-mode=extension` — Route browser commands through the extension bridge instead of launching a new browser. The bridge auto-starts when needed.
- `--json` — Output results in JSON format.

You can also set extension mode permanently via config:

```toml
# ~/.actionbook/config.toml
[browser]
mode = "extension"

[browser.extension]
port = 19222
```

Or via environment variable:

```bash
export ACTIONBOOK_BROWSER_MODE=extension
```
