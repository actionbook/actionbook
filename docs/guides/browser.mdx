description: "Control browsers with Actionbook CLI — isolated or via your own Chrome"
---

The `actionbook browser` command lets AI agents automate any Chromium-based browser. Two modes are available depending on the use case:

## Modes

| Mode | Flag | How It Works | Best For |
|------|------|-------------|----------|
| **Isolated** | *(default)* | Launches a new Chrome with a fresh, dedicated profile | Automated tasks, CI/CD, headless, no user data needed |
| **Extension** | `--browser-mode=extension` | Connects to the user's running Chrome via extension bridge | Tasks requiring existing login sessions, cookies, personal context |

Both modes are designed for AI agents. **Isolated** gives agents a clean, reproducible environment. **Extension** lets agents operate inside the user's real browser — ideal when the task requires existing authentication (e.g., "book my flight", "reply to that email").

## Isolated Mode

Works out of the box — no setup required. The CLI launches a temporary Chrome process with a dedicated profile and connects via CDP.

```bash
actionbook browser open "https://example.com"
actionbook browser click "button[type='submit']"
actionbook browser fill "#search" "actionbook"
actionbook browser screenshot output.png
```

When done, close the browser:

```bash
actionbook browser close
```

## Extension Mode

Extension mode requires a one-time setup to install and load the Chrome extension.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install the extension">
    ```bash
    actionbook extension install
    ```

    This downloads the latest release from GitHub and installs it to `~/.actionbook/extension/`.

    <Tip>
      **Manual download:** If the CLI install fails (e.g., GitHub rate limit), download the `.zip` from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/actionbook/actionbook/releases), unzip it, and load it manually.
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Load into Chrome">
    1. Open `chrome://extensions` in Chrome
    2. Enable **Developer mode** (top-right toggle)
    3. Click **Load unpacked**
    4. Select the directory printed by:

    ```bash
    actionbook extension path
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify the connection">
    The bridge server auto-starts when you run any browser command in extension mode. To verify the connection manually:

    ```bash
    actionbook extension status
    actionbook extension ping
    ```

    You should see `running` and a latency measurement confirming the link is active.
  </Step>
</Steps>

Once set up, add `--browser-mode=extension` to any browser command, or set it permanently:

```bash
export ACTIONBOOK_BROWSER_MODE=extension
```

Or in your config file (`~/.actionbook/config.toml`):

```toml
[browser]
mode = "extension"
```

## Browser Commands

All commands below work in both modes. Add `--browser-mode=extension` to route through the extension bridge.

### Navigation

```bash
actionbook browser open "https://example.com"
actionbook browser goto "https://example.com/login"
actionbook browser back
actionbook browser forward
actionbook browser reload
```

### Page Interaction

```bash
actionbook browser click "button[type='submit']"
actionbook browser fill "#username" "demo"
actionbook browser select "#country" "US"
actionbook browser hover ".menu-item"
actionbook browser focus "#search-input"
actionbook browser press "Enter"
actionbook browser wait "#username" --timeout 10000
```

### Debug & Export

```bash
actionbook browser screenshot output.png --full-page
actionbook browser eval "document.title"
actionbook browser snapshot
actionbook browser html
actionbook browser text
```

### Cookie Operations

```bash
actionbook browser cookies list
actionbook browser cookies get session_id
actionbook browser cookies set demo_cookie hello
actionbook browser cookies delete demo_cookie
actionbook browser cookies clear --domain example.com --yes
```

### Tab Management

```bash
actionbook browser pages
actionbook browser switch tab:123456
```

## Recommended Workflow

Combine action manuals with browser automation for the best results:

```bash
# 1. Find the action manual
actionbook search "github search repos"

# 2. Get verified selectors
actionbook get "<area_id>"

# 3. Execute (add --browser-mode=extension to use your own browser)
actionbook browser open "https://github.com"
actionbook browser fill "#query-builder-test" "actionbook"
actionbook browser click "button[type='submit']"
```

## Shutdown

### Isolated Mode

```bash
actionbook browser close
```

### Extension Mode

Follow this cleanup order:

```bash
# 1. Release the debug connection (detaches from Chrome)
actionbook --browser-mode=extension browser close

# 2. Stop the bridge server
actionbook extension stop

# 3. (Optional) Verify
actionbook extension status    # should show "not running"
```

<Warning>
  Always release the debug connection **before** stopping the bridge. Skipping step 1 may leave Chrome showing an "Actionbook is debugging this browser" banner.
</Warning>

## Extension Security

Extension mode includes multiple security layers to protect your browser.

### Risk Levels

| Level | Description | Example Operations |
|-------|-------------|-------------------|
| **L1** | Read-only, safe | `eval`, `snapshot`, `screenshot` |
| **L2** | Page interaction | `click`, `fill`, `select`, navigation |
| **L3** | Sensitive operations | Cookie writes on banking/payment sites |

L3 operations on sensitive domains trigger a confirmation popup in the extension — you must approve them manually.

### Protocol Handshake

- Connections are authenticated via a protocol version handshake (minimum version: `0.2.0`)
- Only the official Actionbook extension ID is allowed for `chrome-extension://` origins
- Unknown client roles are rejected during the hello handshake

### Network Isolation

- The bridge server only listens on `127.0.0.1` (loopback)
- No external network access is possible
- Origin validation enforces exact host matching

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Ping failed / bridge not running">
    - The bridge auto-starts with browser commands; try running a browser command first
    - Confirm the extension is loaded and enabled in `chrome://extensions`
    - Check that no other process is using port 19222
    - To restart manually: `actionbook extension stop` then run a browser command
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="No tab attached">
    - Make sure Chrome has at least one visible, active tab
    - Run `actionbook --browser-mode=extension browser open <url>` first to attach a tab
    - Avoid `chrome://` pages — the debugger cannot attach to them
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="L3 operation blocked">
    - Sensitive operations (e.g., cookie writes on banking domains) require manual approval
    - Check the extension popup for a pending confirmation dialog
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Custom port not working">
    - The default bridge port is `19222`
    - Set a custom port in `~/.actionbook/config.toml`:
      ```toml
      [browser.extension]
      port = 19223
      ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="GitHub rate limit on install">
    - Anonymous GitHub API allows 60 requests/hour
    - Wait and retry, or download the `.zip` manually from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/actionbook/actionbook/releases)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Offline install">
    - Download `actionbook-extension-v*.zip` from another machine
    - Unzip to `~/.actionbook/extension/`
    - Load it as an unpacked extension in `chrome://extensions`
  </Accordion>
