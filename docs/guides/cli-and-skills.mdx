The Actionbook CLI and Skills/Workflows are the most powerful way to use Actionbook with AI agents.

## Using the CLI

The CLI allows you (and your agents) to search for actions, inspect them, and perform browser automation.

### Installation

```bash
npm install -g @actionbookdev/cli
```

### Core Commands

#### Search Actions

Find available action manuals for a specific task or website.

```bash
actionbook search "airbnb search"
```

#### Get Action Details

Retrieve the full manual for a specific action ID.

```bash
actionbook get "site/airbnb.com/page/home/element/search-button"
```

#### Browser Automation

The CLI includes a built-in browser automation tool that uses the action manuals.

```bash
# Open a website
actionbook browser open airbnb.com

# Click an element using its verified selector
actionbook browser click '[data-testid="search-button"]'

# Fill a form field
actionbook browser fill 'input[name="location"]' 'Tokyo'
```

## Using Skills

Skills are enhanced capabilities that you can add to your AI agent's context. By adding the Actionbook skill, you give your agent a manual on *how* to use Actionbook effectively.

### Add the Skill

Run this command in your project root:

```bash
npx skills add actionbook/actionbook
```

This will download the skill definition to your `.skills` (or similar) directory.

### Benefits of Skills

1.  **Context Awareness**: The skill provides the agent with specific instructions on when and how to call Actionbook CLI commands.
2.  **Workflow Optimization**: It teaches the agent the optimal workflow: `search` -> `get` -> `operate`.
3.  **Reduced Hallucinations**: By following the skill's procedure, the agent relies on verified action manuals instead of guessing DOM selectors.

### Example Agent Workflow

Once the CLI is installed and the Skill is added, you can simply ask your agent:

> "Go to Airbnb and search for a place in Tokyo."

The agent will formatted:
1.  **Read Skill**: Understands it should use `actionbook` CLI.
2.  **Search**: Runs `actionbook search "airbnb search"`.
3.  **Get**: Runs `actionbook get ...` to find the search input and button selectors.
4.  **Operate**: Runs `actionbook browser ...` commands to perform the search safely.
