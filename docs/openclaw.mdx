Use this guide to set up Actionbook in OpenClaw.

## Step 1: Install Actionbook CLI

```bash
npm install -g @actionbookdev/cli
actionbook --version
```

## Step 2: Run `actionbook setup`

```bash
actionbook setup
```

During setup, make sure Skills are installed to **OpenClaw global**.

Verify Actionbook is ready in OpenClaw:

```bash
openclaw skills check
```

Quick smoke test:

```bash
actionbook search "airbnb search listings tokyo" --domain airbnb.com
```

You should see at least one result with an `ID`.

## Step 3: Disable OpenClaw built-in browser and route browser tasks to Actionbook

Disable the built-in OpenClaw browser:

```bash
openclaw config set browser.enabled false --json
```

Then update `tools.deny` in `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json`:

- If `tools.deny` is empty/unset, set it to include `"browser"`
- If `tools.deny` already has entries, append `"browser"` (do not replace other rules)

Apply changes:

```bash
openclaw gateway restart
```

Add this instruction to `~/.openclaw/workspace/TOOLS.md`:

```markdown
## Browser automation preference
- Use Actionbook CLI for all website/browser operations.
- Do not use the built-in OpenClaw browser tool unless explicitly asked.
- Follow: `actionbook search` -> `actionbook get` -> operate.
```

Restart once after editing `TOOLS.md`:

```bash
openclaw gateway restart
```

## Try it

Ask OpenClaw:

```text
Use Actionbook to find the best action manual for Airbnb search, then give me the exact selectors and field values to execute.
```
