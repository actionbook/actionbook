Use this guide to connect Actionbook to OpenClaw from a clean setup.

This flow is **CLI + Skills only** (no MCP configuration required).

## Step 1: Install Actionbook CLI

```bash
npm install -g @actionbookdev/cli
actionbook --version
```

## Step 2: Verify Actionbook Works

```bash
actionbook search "airbnb search listings tokyo" --domain airbnb.com
```

You should get at least one result with an `ID`.

## Step 3: Check OpenClaw Skill Readiness

```bash
openclaw skills check
```

Make sure `actionbook` appears under `Ready to use`.

If it does not:

```bash
npm install -g @actionbookdev/cli
openclaw gateway restart
openclaw skills check
```

## Step 4: Use Actionbook from OpenClaw

Ask OpenClaw:

```text
Use Actionbook to find the best action manual for Airbnb search, then explain which selectors to click and fill.
```

For best results, ask OpenClaw to follow the Actionbook docs workflow:

```text
Use Actionbook in CLI + Skills mode: search first, then get the most relevant manual, then give me the exact selectors and field values to execute.
```
