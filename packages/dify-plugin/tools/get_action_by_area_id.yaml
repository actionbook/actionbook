    IMPORTANT: You must call "search_actions" FIRST to find the area ID,
    then pass it to this tool. Do NOT guess area IDs.

    WORKFLOW:
    1. Call "search_actions" with a keyword (e.g., "github login").
    2. Pick the best matching area ID from the search results.
    3. Call this tool with that area ID.
    4. Use the returned CSS/XPath selectors to interact with the page.

    The response includes:
    - Page URL and structure
    - UI element details (type, description)
    - Multiple selectors (CSS, XPath, ARIA) with confidence scores
    - Allowed interaction methods (click, type, select, etc.)
