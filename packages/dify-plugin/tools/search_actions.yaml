      Search for website action manuals by keyword.

  llm: >
    Search the Actionbook database for verified website action manuals.
    Use this tool FIRST when a user needs to automate browser interactions
    (clicking buttons, filling forms, navigating pages).

    HOW TO USE:
    1. Call this tool with a descriptive keyword like "github login",
       "google search box", or "twitter post button".
    2. The results contain area IDs (format: "site.com:path:area_name").
    3. Pick the most relevant area ID from the results.
    4. Then call the "get_action_by_area_id" tool with that area ID
       to get the full CSS/XPath selectors and interaction instructions.

    TIPS:
    - Search by task description, not element name
      (e.g., "arxiv search papers" instead of "search button").
    - Use the domain parameter to filter results to a specific website.
    - Default limit is 10 results; increase if needed (max 50).
